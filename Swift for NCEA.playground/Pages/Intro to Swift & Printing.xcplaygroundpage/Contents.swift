# Why are we learning Swift?

There are many computer programming languages, all with their own strengths and weaknesses.

We will be learning Swift because:
 * Very easy to pick up due to it's natural language
 * Allows rapid development
 * Very flexible
 * Able to see what your code is doing it as it runs

Swift allows a smooth transition into the programming world.

We are using Swift 2.

# Where am I?

You're inside what's called a Playground. A playground is a special type of interactive file used for trying out code. However, we'll be using it to learn to code in Swift as well!

Right here is the main view - this is where you'll read and write code. To the left is the pages of this book (the project navigator), and to the right is where any output and code that is run will be shown.

/*:
# Printing
This is not printing to a printer, but printing to the output window. We will use this if we want to display something to the user.

** Syntax: **

`print("what you want to print")`

*/

print("Hi, my name is Sam")

/*:
# Exercise: Write a program that prints out your name. It should just be one line of code.
*/

// Write your code below this line


/*:
Wait, what is `// Something` mean? This is a **comment**. Anything with two slashes in front of it like //this is a comment, and this means the computer does not treat it like code. Comments are handy to say what your code is doing, or as notes to someone else who might want to change it later on.
*/

print("This is my first print line")// the "\n" at the end just means "new line", so a new line will be between this
print("and the next print line")



//: [Previous](@previous) [Next](@next)
